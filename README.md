This is Enhanced, a lightly modded, optimized, and multiplayer-oriented modpack based around the [EnhancedCraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/enhancedcraft) mod.

This modpack also includes many useful quality-of-life mods to improve the vanilla experience, essential FPS optimization mods that replicate many OptiFine features and provide great performance, and the [Essential](https://essential.gg) mod to vastly improve the social aspect of Minecraft: Java Edition.

### Open-Source
Enhanced (and most of the included mods) are open source. Any recommendations or questions are appreciated! Issues can be reported [here](https://github.com/spxctreofficial/enhanced-modpack/issues).

### FAQ

> **Q:** Will my performance suffer compared to [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized)?
>
> **A:** Most of the essential mods included in Fabulously Optimized are also included in this modpack. That means that, while there may be a few more obscure mods included with Fabulously Optimized, performance will be largely identical and unnoticeable.

> **Q:** How do I install this modpack?
>
> **Modrinth:** [Tutorial](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/)

> **Q:** What mod loader is this modpack built for?
>
> **A:** Fabric. (Quilt should technically work with most of these mods, but may break later down the line as Quilt diverges from the Fabric Project).
